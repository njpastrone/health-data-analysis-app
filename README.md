# How much do you know about life expectancy?

# Description:
This app allows users to analyze global health trends including life expectancy at birth and dozens of other health outcomes. Users can also analyze the relationships between economic indicators and health outcomes. This app aims to create a comprehensive dashboard for users to perform exploratory data analysis through static and spatial data visualization and statistical analysis using a panel linear model.

Built in R, this project relied heavily on the Tidyverse package for data cleaning and visualization, and the Shiny package for the app interface. Data was sourced from various public databases compiled by the World Bank and United Nations.

This app can be used by public health professionals, market researchers, and academics to evaluate global health outcomes and economic statistics. It was originally developed for Dr. Richard Ressler's DATA-613 Data Science class at American University.
