# Use Case

This Shiny app is designed to enable users to engage in interactive exploration and robust statistical modeling, allowing them to gain deeper insights into the various factors that influence life expectancy across different nations. The predictors include some economic indicators like gross domestic product (GDP) and income levels, demographic measures such as population size, and health-related factors like government and private healthcare expenditures, and dietary habits. All those variables provide a comprehensive understanding of life expectancy. It is aimed at researchers, policymakers, and educators who want to explore relationships between health, economic, and demographic variables and their impact on life expectancy.

# Data Source and Structure

## Data Source

The data in this research are compiled from a range of publicly available sources. Most of our data comes from various [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics?l=en#) databases: the World Bank Development Indicators database, the World Bank Health Nutrition and Population Statistics Database, and the World Bank Education Statistics Database. This data were joined with food supply data from the United Nations [Food and Agriculture Organization database](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data), sourced through [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/food-supply). Additional shape file data were sourced through the [rnaturalearth](https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearth) package.

## Data Structure

The dataset used in this application contains 17,600 observations and 45 variables. Each row represents one observation for a country and a specific year. Each column represents a unique metric or attribute, all 45 variables are listed below:

```{r}
data <- read.csv("../data/merged_full_dataset.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
colnames(data)
```

# EDA Inputs, Controls and Outputs

## Dependent Variable Selection

In order to perform EDA in this app, users must select at least one dependent variable. The dependent variable is the target variable that you're trying to understand or predict, typically displayed on the Y-axis of scatterplots and histograms.

**Example Dependent Variables:**

life_expectancy_at_birth

gdp_per_capita_ppp

## Independent Variables

Independent variables are the explanatory variables that you believe might influence or relate to the dependent variable. These are typically shown on the X-axis of scatterplots and histograms.

**Example Independent Variables:**

government_health_exppc_ppp

urban_population_rate

## Visualization Outputs Based on Number of Selected Variables

Depending on how many variables you select (combining both independent and dependent variables), the app will generate different types of plots.

### Scenario 1: Two Total Variables

When you select two variables in total (one independent variable and one dependent variable), the app will produce the following visualizations:

Histogram of the Dependent Variable:

This shows the distribution of the dependent variable.

Histogram of the Independent Variable:

This shows the distribution of the independent variable.

Bivariate Scatter Plot:

This plot visualizes the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.

**Example:**

Independent Variable: gdp_per_capita_ppp

Dependent Variable: life_expectancy_at_birth

The app will generate:

A histogram of life_expectancy_at_birth.

A histogram of gdp_per_capita_ppp.

A scatter plot of gdp_per_capita_ppp vs. life_expectancy_at_birth.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example1.png", error = FALSE)
```

### Scenario 2: Three or More Total Variables

When you select three or more variables in total (e.g., one dependent variable and two or more independent variables), the app will generate a pair plot (scatterplot matrix).

Pair Plot:

A matrix of scatterplots showing all possible pairwise combinations of the selected variables. This helps visualize correlations and relationships between multiple variables simultaneously.

**Example:**

Independent Variables: gdp_per_capita_ppp, government_health_exppc_ppp

Dependent Variable: life_expectancy_at_birth

The app will generate a pair plot with scatterplots for:

gdp_per_capita_ppp vs. life_expectancy_at_birth

government_health_exppc_ppp vs. life_expectancy_at_birth

gdp_per_capita_ppp vs. government_health_exppc_ppp

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/example2.png", error = FALSE)
```

# Statistical Analysis Inputs, Controls and Outputs

## Inputs

1.  **Select Variables**:
    -   Choose **one or more independent variables** (predictors).\
    -   Select **one dependent variable** (target).
2.  **Choose Tests**:\
    The following tests are available in the **"Statistical Analysis"** tab:
    -   **Panel Linear Model**
    -   **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**
    -   **Breusch-Pagan Test**
    -   **Shapiro-Wilk Test**
3.  **Optional Transformations**:
    -   Check the box for **Log Transformation** if needed:
        -   **Log Transform Independent Variables**
        -   **Log Transform Dependent Variable**
4.  **Run Analysis**:\
    Click the **"Run Analysis"** button to execute the selected tests.

## Test Descriptions

### 1. **Panel Linear Model**

-   **Purpose**:\
    Runs a linear regression model for **panel data** (data with multiple observations over time for the same entities, e.g., countries). This test controls for:

    -   **Individual heterogeneity** (differences between entities).
    -   **Autocorrelation** (correlation of a variable with itself over time).

-   **Interpretation**:\
    Each p-value indicates whether the corresponding predictor (independent variable) significantly affects the dependent variable.

-   **Hypotheses**:

    -   **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: (\beta = 0) (The predictor has no effect on the dependent variable).\
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: (\beta \neq 0) (The predictor has a significant effect).

### 2. **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**

-   **Purpose**:\
    Measures the degree of **multicollinearity** (correlation among independent variables). High multicollinearity can make regression coefficients unreliable.

-   **Interpretation**:

    -   **VIF \< 10**: No significant multicollinearity.\
    -   **VIF \> 10**: Significant multicollinearity; consider removing or combining correlated variables.

-   **Hypotheses**:

    -   **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: No multicollinearity exists.\
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: Multicollinearity exists.

### 3. **Breusch-Pagan Test**

-   **Purpose**:\
    Detects **heteroscedasticity** (changing variance of residuals). Heteroscedasticity can invalidate standard regression inferences.

-   **Interpretation**:

    -   **Low p-value (\< 0.05)**: Heteroscedasticity is present.\
    -   **High p-value (\> 0.05)**: Residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).

-   **Hypotheses**:

    -   **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Residuals have constant variance (homoscedasticity).\
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: Residuals have changing variance (heteroscedasticity).

### 4. **Shapiro-Wilk Test**

-   **Purpose**:\
    Tests the **normality of residuals**. Normality of residuals is a key assumption in linear regression.

-   **Interpretation**:

    -   **Low p-value (\< 0.05)**: Residuals significantly deviate from normality.\
    -   **High p-value (\> 0.05)**: Residuals are normally distributed.

-   **Hypotheses**:

    -   **Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: Residuals are normally distributed.\
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ)**: Residuals are not normally distributed.

# Choropleth Map

**Purpose**: Visualize geographic data by shading regions based on a selected variable, highlighting spatial patterns and trends.

**Features**:

-   Interactive world map with variable and year selection.
-   Color-blind-friendly palette option.
-   Handles missing data with warnings and neutral shading.
-   Uses Jenks breaks, quantiles, or default bins for appropriate color scaling.

**Workflow**:

-   Filter Data: Select data by year and variable.
-   Merge Data: Join filtered data with geographic shapefiles.
-   Color Mapping: Apply suitable binning strategies for accurate representation.
-   Render Map: Shade regions, display tooltips, and add a dynamic legend.

**Applications**: Explore global trends, identify outliers, and present spatial insights effectively.
