# Topic and Data
##  Updates on the problem statement and use case
**Problem statement** :
This Shiny app is designed to enable users to engage in interactive exploration and robust statistical modeling, allowing them to gain deeper insights into the various factors that influence life expectancy across different nations. Specifically, the primary goal of this app is to analyze global patterns in life expectancy by applying different multiple regression models. These models will help uncover the extent to which different predictors impact life expectancy and how these impacts vary across regions and demographics. The predictors include some economic indicators like gross domestic product (GDP) and income levels, demographic measures such as population size, and health-related factors like government and private healthcare expenditures, dietary habits, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, it includes critical public health metrics, such as immunization rates and the prevalence of preventable diseases. All those variables provide a comprehensive understanding of life expectancy.

**Use case**:
By presenting data in an interactive and visually engaging manner, the app allows users to identify trends, patterns, and correlations about life expectancy that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, users can explore how economic indicators like GDP and average income levels correlate with life expectancy. Similarly, users can investigate how health expenditures, both governmental and private, impact life expectancy. The app also provides insights into other critical factors such as demographic variables, dietary habits, lifestyle choices, immunization rates, and the prevalence of chronic diseases. Users can analyze how these factors interact with broader societal trends, offering a holistic view of the determinants of life expectancy.


## Updates on proposed data sources and status of data collection, cleaning and tidying
We would finish data collection before 11/17/2024 and finish the cleaning and tidying work before 11/24/2024.


# Ethical Review
- An ethical review is undertaken to ensure the app maintains privacy, transparency, and integrity throughout its lifecycle.

- Data Privacy: As this desktop application uses only country-level aggregate data, it does not collect or analyze personal information of individuals or identifiable data. Protection of data privacy also depends on using public sources of data or databases that obtain consent, such as by the World Health Organization and World Bank, as per the ethical guidelines. These practices are coupled with what organizations such as the American Statistical Association requires. Such an organization calls for respect in the privacy of subjects giving data.

- Transparency of Data Source: It is an ethical duty to take proper care in acknowledging all data sources. The app explicitly cites each used dataset that is being analyzed to let users understand where the data emanates from. This follows the ASA’s Code of Conduct, which calls for transparency in data analysis and in citing sources.

- Minimization of Bias and Interpretation: An important ethical consideration is avoiding bias in analysis and interpretation. Because the app presents data openly and provides a variety of predictors, it allows for a somewhat unbiased discovery of which different factors affect life expectancy. Also, to avoid misinterpretations, users are informed that not every correlation implies causation.

- Responsible Use of Findings: Results would be made available to users, including policy and the general public in such a way that informs and enlightens without making claims of causality, which could result in injurious or biased policymaking. Keeping the interpretation responsible ensures alignment with the ethical guidelines provided by The Data Science Association (DSA): it draws particular attention to responsible communication of analytical results.

# App Design

## Updates and Changes

### Following the peer review comments that were implemented, the major edits and enhancements include:

1. **Intro Tab**:  
   There is an added tab called **Introduction** that does some groundwork in clearly explaining what the app is meant for and what function it will serve, from where the data within comes, and what benefits this might bring. This can help to ensure that the users immediately get an overview of what functionalities the app provides and for whom.

2. **Override Side Panels**:  
   Each tab has now fitted with a side panel, which is customized to the workings of the section it represents; this helps in design by making options and features both intuitive and relevant to the tab highlighted.

3. **Choropleth Map Improvements**:  
   The **Choropleth Map** now supports interactive visualizations. For now, the current dataset uses placeholders, but this can and will be upgraded using real-world data to gain further geographical insights.

### Changes from Previous Assignment

Other unification of layout and sections' description was done to provide fluent user experience from one tab to another.

- The **Data Summary** table has been moved to the end for logical flow: analyses first and overview of the dataset second.  
- This PR improves the **Exploratory Data Analysis** tab by adding more options on **multivariate analysis**, namely: pair plots, correlation matrices, and scatter plots to give flexibility in analyzing complex relationships within the data.

---

## Specific Layout 

The following tab structure has been logically and user-friendly in order of importance for the app layout.

1. **Introduction Tab**:  
   Overview: a short description of the app, its purpose, where it acquires the data, and who would be the typical user of such an application.
  
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("intro_tab.png", error = FALSE)
```

2. **Correlation Matrix Tab**:  
   It enables the user to study, by using a correlation matrix, the relationship between preselected variables.
   
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("correlation_tab.png", error = FALSE)
```


3. **Exploratory Data Analysis Tab**:  
   It dynamically offers data visualization with various options, such as scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices, including the opportunity for log transformations and a multivariate analysis.
   
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("exploratory_tab.png", error = FALSE)
```


4. **Statistical Analysis Tab**:  
   Model assumptions and their performance could be checked through various statistical tests, visualizations of residual and QQ plots, F-tests, t-tests, and checks for multicollinearity, among others.
   
   
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("stats_tab.png", error = FALSE)
```


5. **Choropleth Map Tab**:  
   This will be displaying an interactive map with different color schemes based on the selection of variables. **This feature will be further developed with the integration of real data.**
   
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("map_tab.png", error = FALSE)
```


6. **Summary of Tab Data**:  
   Provides a comprehensive summary of the dataset by which the user can view the descriptive statistics and choose variables of interest.
   
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("data_tab.png", error = FALSE)
```

# Risk Assessment Mitigation
- The largest risks for the completion of our project regard data cleaning and availability. We are obtaining data from many sources and for many variables, and sometimes data that appears to be complete can be minimal or incomplete. We may run into issues with data availability and have to reduce our list of variables in question. We have partially mitigated this problem by starting with a large number of variables of interest.

- In the case we are unable to locate good data for some of our variables, we will still have enough data to conduct meaningful analysis. In the data cleaning stage, we may run into issues with joining data from many different sources in different formats. We will likely have to spend a fair amount of time solely on the data cleaning phase. 

- However, with our combined experience cleaning data from this class and other projects, we should be able to fix any of the data cleaning problems we encounter. Other problems may arise with spatial data analysis and the creation of our map, and with statistical analysis, during which we will need to make sure to use the proper methodology for panel data.
